Here's the software to run on the STM32F401RDT6 on board version 1.0.

To compile the software on GNU/Linux and flash it on the board:
Install make, arm-none-eabi-gcc, arm-none-eabi-binutils and stm32flash.
If your distribution does not have a package for stm32flash, get it from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm32flash/

Run make to compile.

Connect a USB to 3.3 V UART converter to the UART pins on the board.
Put a jumper in BOOT0 position. Press reset button. Run something like:
stm32flash /dev/ttyUSB0 -w build/dodekaedri.bin

After programming, disconnect BOOT0 jumper and press reset again.

(Change /dev/ttyUSB0 to something else if needed. Also note that you may need
 to add yourself in group "dialout" to have permissions to serial ports.)





DEVELOPMENT

The software uses initialization code generated by ST's tool STM32CubeMX.
The code is generated for an IDE called SW4STM32 which you can use if you like.
To allow use of any text editor and make without special IDEs, a Makefile is
generated by CubeMX2Makefile.py.
